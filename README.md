# 📦 Quantum Optimization for Distributed Order Management (DOM)

## Executive Summary

This project presents a **Hybrid Classical + Quantum-inspired Distributed Order Management (DOM)** platform developed for the **WISER–Nestlé Optimization Challenge**.

The platform intelligently assigns customer orders to warehouses by combining optimization techniques with business constraints. It maximizes revenue, improves order fulfillment, balances warehouse workloads, reduces logistics costs, and provides explainable recommendations through an interactive dashboard.

Instead of making allocation decisions manually, the system evaluates every order using multiple operational factors such as inventory availability, shipping cost, warehouse capacity, delivery priority, penalties, and business value before selecting the most suitable fulfillment strategy.

# Problem Statement

Large companies like Nestlé receive thousands of customer orders every day.

Each order can potentially be fulfilled from multiple warehouses.

Choosing the wrong warehouse can lead to:

- High transportation costs
- Inventory shortages
- Warehouse overload
- Late deliveries
- Poor customer satisfaction
- Increased carbon emissions

Traditional rule-based assignment methods cannot always optimize these conflicting objectives simultaneously.

This project addresses that challenge by using optimization techniques to automatically generate better order allocation decisions.

# Project Objectives

The project aims to:

- Maximize order fulfillment
- Improve Fill Rate
- Maximize revenue
- Reduce logistics cost
- Reduce penalty costs
- Balance warehouse utilization
- Improve inventory utilization
- Generate explainable recommendations
- Prepare the workflow for future quantum optimization

# Dataset

The project uses operational logistics data containing:

- Plant
- Material Number
- Order Quantity
- Inventory
- Shipping Cost
- Revenue
- Warehouse Capacity
- Delivery Priority
- Penalty Cost
- Fill Rate Threshold
- Risk Score
- Carbon Emissions

These attributes are used to optimize warehouse allocation.

---

# Optimization Approach

The optimization engine evaluates each order using business constraints.

Objective:

- Maximize revenue
- Maximize fulfilled orders
- Minimize shipping cost
- Minimize penalties
- Balance warehouse utilization

Constraints include:

- Inventory availability
- Warehouse capacity
- Delivery priority
- Fill rate requirements
- Logistics limitations

---

# Classical Optimization

The current implementation uses **Google OR-Tools**.

OR-Tools solves the warehouse assignment problem using mathematical optimization while satisfying all operational constraints.

The optimizer selects the best warehouse for every order.

---

# Quantum Optimization

The architecture has been designed to support future quantum optimization using **Qiskit**.

The future implementation can replace the classical optimizer with algorithms such as:

- QAOA
- Quantum Annealing
- Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization

This enables scalability for increasingly complex optimization problems.
